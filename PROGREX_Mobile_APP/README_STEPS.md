WHAT HAVE WE DONE SO FAR?

1. using quick setup from: https://expo.github.io/router/docs/

âœ… Your project is ready!

To run your project, navigate to the directory and run one of the following npm commands.        

- cd PROGREX_Mobile_APP
- npm run android
- npm run ios # you need to use macOS to build the iOS project - use the Expo app if you need to 
  do iOS development without a Mac
- npm run web


2. Create folder 'app' with files '_index.js' & '_layout.js'

3. The layout should render a "Stack" component, that defines how users can navigate througth the app.
